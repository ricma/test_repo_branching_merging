# test_repo_branching_merging
Small test to demonstrate branches and merges

## Aim of the Repository

Demonstrate how branches and merges work

## Content of the Repository

Two _Python_ modules,
[function_and_expansion.py](./function_and_expansion.py) and
[use_taylor_expansion.py](./use_taylor_expansion.py). The first one
contains maths definitions, the second one uses them.

## Open Tasks

1. Add more prose to ```__doc__``` string in
   [use_taylor_expansion.py](./use_taylor_expansion.py)

   -- If you work on this, then use a branch called
   _rework_doc_.

2. Add Taylor order up to ```5``` in
   [function_and_expansion.py](./function_and_expansion.py),
   i.e. add ```+ x ** 5 / 120```.

   -- If you work on this, then use a branch called
   _rework_taylor_.

3. Rewrite ```if``` statements in
   [function_and_expansion.py](./function_and_expansion.py),
   i.e. like ```if order in [2, 3]:```

   -- If you work on this, then use a branch called
   _rework_taylor_.

4. Add ```cos``` to the examples in
   [function_and_expansion.py](./function_and_expansion.py),
   i.e. add a function ```f2```. Add an empty stub for the
   Taylor series, like first version of ```Taylor_f1```.

   -- If you work on this, then use a branch called
   _new_feature_.
